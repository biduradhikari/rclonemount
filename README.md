# rclonemount
Mounts selected drives in rclone config.

The script reads the names of remotes listed in rclone.config.
It then outputs the list of unmounted remotes in a multiple selection list. User selects the remotes to mount and hits "Mount".
If all remotes are already mounted, a dialog box says so.

Unmounting should be done from OS.
